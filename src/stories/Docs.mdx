# Introduction
React-File-Tree is designed to be a kitchen-sink component that you can drop in and forget about.
It does however, come with a multitude of customization options to make it behave like you want.
The stories contained in this storybook go over the majority of the options and customizations you can use,
the controls panel allows you to toggle some common tree-level options for each story.

# Styling
There are included styles that can be used with the default renderer to just drop in and go, however,
these styles will not apply if a custom renderer or any of the classname options are changed.  The styles 
can be used as a reference point if you choose to go custom.

# Public API
```typescript
const DefaultRenderOptions: RenderOptions = {
  childClassName: 'react-file-tree-child',
  expandTool: <div className="react-file-tree-child-button">+</div>,
  collapseTool: <div className="react-file-tree-child-button">-</div>,
  indentWidth: 16
};

const TreeDefaultProps: Partial<TreeProps> = {
  className: 'react-file-tree',
  renderOptions: DefaultRenderOptions,
  filterFn: (node: Node, filter: string) =>
    node.name.toLowerCase().includes(filter.toLowerCase())
};

```
---
### Node
#### id
A unique identifier for the node
#### name
The default display text for the node
#### data
Arbitrary data for convenience
#### children
The `Node` children of this node (for building the tree)
#### expanded - disabled - selected - selectable
Override default state of the node

---
### RenderOptions - For the included default renderer
#### childClassName
The classname prefix to be applied to the rendered children
#### expandTool
The component/jsx element to be used for expanding
#### collapseTool
The component/jsx element to be used for collapsing
#### indentWidth
The width of indent for each level in pixels

---
### ChildRenderer
This type describes the expected format of a custom renderer.
You don't have to use all the passed properties, however, you lose functionality if don't use it all.
> Note: The `Custom Node` story shows an example usage

#### node
The current `Node` for rendering
#### state
The current `NodeState` for the current `Node`
> Note: Depth represents the current level of the node.

#### props
The props of the `Tree`
#### callbacks
Callbacks to be called when the corresponding event should occur.

---
### TreeProps
These props control the overall behavior of the tree.

#### data
The array of `Node` to be used.
#### className
The classname prefix to be applied to the tree's organizational components
#### childRenderer
A custom render function to be used instead of the default renderer
#### renderOptions
Options to be passed to the default renderer
#### virtual
Whether or not to use virtualization to improve performance on large trees
#### onExpand
A callback that is called when a node is expanded
#### onCollapse
A callback that is called when a node is collapsed
#### selectable
Enable or disable selection
#### multiSelect
Whether or not to allow multiple selections
#### onSelect
A callback that is called when a node is selected
#### onDeselect
A callback that is called when a node is deselected
> Note: This event only fires when the user explicitly clicks a node to deselect it

#### disabled
Whether or not the tree should allow interaction
#### filterable
Whether or not the tree should be filterable
#### filter
The current value to filter for
#### filterFn
A custom filtering function to be used instead of the default filter function
